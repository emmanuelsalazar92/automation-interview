## Framework Selection

For this test I decided to go with Playwright. The first reason is quite simple: it’s the tool I’ve worked with the most, so I can be faster and more effective with it. On top of that, Playwright gives me some clear advantages over Cypress, like true cross-browser support and the option to run tests on both desktop and mobile, which was important for this assignment.

I also like how easy it is to use thanks to the integration with VS Code, and the features it brings out of the box — things like auto-waiting and handling multiple browser contexts make tests more stable. Finally, Playwright has strong backing from Microsoft and a community that’s growing really fast, which gives me confidence it’s a solid choice not just for now, but for the future as well.

## Analysis and Test Report

***Test Execution Status: PASS*** All automated scenarios ran successfully on desktop and mobile.

***Issues/Failures:*** None observed; the end-to-end flow behaved as expected.

***Lighthouse (Accessibility/Performance):*** Not implemented in this iteration.
